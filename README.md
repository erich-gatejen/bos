The Battle Operating System (BOS) was originally meant to host Corewar contests. It was a momentary obsession among some of my Air Force colleagues. I got a bit carried away and redesigned the Virtual Machine and implemented an Assembler for my new instruction set. So as to encourage my colleagues to convert to BOS, I wrote a programmer's guide. I never released this to the public as I didn't think it would go anywhere.

The first version was a fast hack, thus the oversized source files, lack of structure, and junky code. I started a rewrite to clean it up, but then we lost interest. This was my first personal project to attempt C++.

I don't remember why I terminated everything with semicolons,including blocks. It must have been a bad habit I appear to be cured of it.
